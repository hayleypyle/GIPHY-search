# GIPHY-search

## Hayley Pyle

This is a website that can search for gifs using the GIPHY API. 
- This website generates 16 gifs based on any keyword typed in the search bar. It then displays the gifs in a grid for the user to view and choose from. 
- This website uses .html, .css, and .js
- Future improvements that can be made to this website would be:
    - A "trending" page to see gifs that are currently being used by many users. 
    - A "new" page to see which gifs are newest to GIPHY. 
    - The ability to scroll and see more gifs beyond 16.
